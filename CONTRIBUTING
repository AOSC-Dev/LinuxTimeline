Linux Distribution Timeline | CONTRIBUTING
------------------------------------------

Because I want to keep it simple and coherent with previous versions by
the original maintainers, I decided to make this very simple guide of
how to contribute to this project. You are not obliged to follow this,
but you'll ease my job if you do. :)

Formatting
==========

Remember to keep the CSV coherent, newest distro will always go to the
lowest place. And also, please group it accordingly, a Debian-based
distro should never be grouped with a distro based on Red Hat.

I'll just give an example of how we can get it done.

	"Debian"
		"Ubuntu" based on Debian
			"Kubuntu" based on Ubuntu
			"Linux Mint" based on Ubuntu
		"Crunchbang" based on Debian
	"Red Hat"
		"Fedora Core" based on Red Hat
		"CentOS" based on Red Hat

Keep the original timeline
==========================

Don't understand what I meant? For example, S.u.S.E, before rebasing
their code to Red Hat, they originally used Slack as their upstream. If
you ever see this happening in the future, add it to the connectors,
again, coherent with the distros. You may see "Thickness" in the CSV in
the "Connectors" part. The thickness may vary from 1, 2 or 4. It has
already been explained in the build generated by gldt, but I'll just
explain it again.

	* 1: Influence, developer switch
	     (e.g.: CRUX to Arch)
	* 2: Rebasing, substantial code flow, project overtaking
	     (e.g. Red Hat to SuSE)
	* 4: Developer & code sharing, project merging
	     (e.g. Maemo to MeeGo)

Sorry for my bad writing, and this is still a work in progress.
